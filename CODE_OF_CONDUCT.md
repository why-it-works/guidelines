# 🧭 Code of Conduct — why_it_works

We’re building an environment where great ideas thrive and people feel respected, safe, and empowered to contribute. That only works if we hold ourselves — and each other — to high standards.

## 🚦 Core Principles

- 🤝 Treat every individual with respect, regardless of experience, background, or opinion.
- 📢 Give constructive feedback — don’t attack people, attack problems.
- 🧘‍♂️ Stay calm, especially during disagreements.
- 🧠 Assume good intent, but speak up when lines are crossed.

## 🚫 Not Tolerated

- Hate speech, discrimination, or harassment of any kind
- Threats, personal insults, or toxic sarcasm
- Publicly shaming or belittling others
- Unwelcome advances, whether verbal, physical, or digital
- Persistent disruption of conversations or collaboration

## 📍 Applies To

- Repositories, issues, discussions, pull requests
- Community channels (Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Meetups, hackathons, and offline events
- DMs that stem from community interactions

## 🛠 Reporting & Enforcement

We take every report seriously. If you see something, say something.
